# Design and Implementation

This ESP32 example uses the OPTIGA™ Trust M host library for hardware-backed security.

**Key points:**
- ESP32 communicates with OPTIGA Trust M via I2C.
- Private keys are stored and used inside OPTIGA.
- The demo prints results to the serial monitor.

For deeper OPTIGA features and data sheets, see the Tutorial Hub resources.
